# MDS in a box
This project serves as end to end example of running the "Modern Data Stack" in a local environment. Development is primarily done on Windows via WSL, which means Mac is untested (but should work).

## Current progress
Right now, you can get the nba schedule and elo ratings from this project and generate the following query. more to come, see to-dos at bottom of readme. And of course, the dbt docs are self hosted in Github Pages, [check them out here](https://matsonj.github.io/nba-monte-carlo/).

## Getting started - Windows
1. Create your WSL environment. Open a PowerShell terminal running as an administrator and execute:
```
wsl --install
```
* If this was the first time WSL has been installed, restart your machine.

2. Open Ubuntu in your terminal and update your packages. 
```
sudo apt-get update
```
3. Install python3.
```
sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3-pip python3.8-venv
```
4. clone the this repo.
```
mkdir meltano-projects
cd meltano-projects
git clone https://github.com/matsonj/nba-monte-carlo.git
# Go one folder level down into the folder that git just created
cd nba-monte-carlo
```
5. build your project & run your pipeline
```
make build
make run
```
6. Connect duckdb to superset. first, create an admin users
```
meltano invoke superset:create-admin
```
 - then boot up superset
```
meltano run superset:ui
```
 - lastly, connect it to duck db. navigate to localhost:8088, login, and add duckdb as a database.

   - SQL Alchemy URL: ```duckdb:////tmp/mdsbox.db```

   - Advanced Settings > Other > Engine Parameters: ```{"connect_args":{"read_only":true}}```

7. Explore your data inside superset. Go to SQL Labs > SQL Editor and write a custom query. A good example is ```SELECT * FROM reg_season_end```.

## Running your pipeline on demand
After your run ```make run```, you can run your pipeline again at any time with the following meltano command:
```
meltano run tap-spreadsheets-anywhere target-duckdb dbt-duckdb:build
```

## Using Parquet instead of a database
There is an additional target in the meltano.yml file as well as dbt profiles.yml file that allows use of parquet as a storage medium. This can be invoked with ```make parquet```. 

## Todos
- [x] replace reg season schedule with 538 schedule
- [x] add table for results
- [x] add config options in dbt vars to ignore completed games
- [x] make simulator only sim incomplete games
- [ ] add table for new ratings
- [ ] add config to use original or new ratings


## Optional stuff
- [ ] add dbt tests
- [ ] add model descriptions
- [x] change elo calculation to a udf
- [x] make playoff elimination stuff a macro (param: schedule type)
